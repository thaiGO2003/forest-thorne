# Phaser 4 UI Hit-Test and Depth Patterns

## The core rule: Phaser input uses topOnly by default

Phaser's input manager defaults to `topOnly = true`, meaning pointer events route to the **highest-depth interactive game object** at a given point. A full-viewport invisible "dismiss zone" added on top of your UI to catch outside-the-panel clicks will silently steal every click — including clicks on buttons, tabs, and interactive text nested beneath it.

## Symptom

- Buttons that used to work stopped responding after adding a "click anywhere to dismiss" overlay.
- Arrow buttons and toggles in a settings panel silently ignore taps/clicks.
- Drag-to-scroll "blocking zones" on a guide panel make every interactive child underneath non-interactive.

A common manifestation: a drag-overlay or dismiss zone added at the default depth sits above every interactive child. Phaser's topOnly routing sends every pointer event to the invisible overlay, never to the buttons beneath it.

## Pattern A — Negative depth (invisible dismiss zones)

For a full-viewport invisible zone that catches outside-the-panel clicks WITHOUT intercepting the panel's own interactive children:

```typescript
const dismissZone = this.add.rectangle(0, 0, cam.width, cam.height, 0x000000, 0.001)
  .setOrigin(0, 0)
  .setInteractive();

// CRITICAL — push the dismiss zone BELOW normal game-object depth so it is
// hit-tested LAST, not first. Phaser's topOnly routing means any positive-depth
// interactive child above this zone still receives pointer events first.
dismissZone.setDepth(-9999);

dismissZone.on('pointerdown', () => { this.closePanel(); });
```

Only use Pattern A when the dismiss zone MUST be behind the panel's own interactive elements.

## Pattern B — Scoped `setTopOnly(false)` on an overlay scene

If you genuinely want every overlapping interactive to receive the event (e.g., a drag gesture should also update a panel button's hover state):

```typescript
// In an overlay scene's create():
this.input.setTopOnly(false);
```

Scope this narrowly — turning `topOnly` off globally cascades into surprising consequences (your own UI starts firing double events). Do it only in the scene that needs it.

## Pattern C — Open/close gate (destroy zone on open)

Sometimes the cleanest fix is: don't have the dismiss zone while the panel is open. The panel's own background rectangle catches clicks; the dismiss zone only exists while the panel is closed waiting to be opened.

```typescript
openPanel(): void {
  if (this.dismissZone) {
    this.dismissZone.destroy();
    this.dismissZone = undefined;
  }
  this.panel.setVisible(true);
}

closePanel(): void {
  this.panel.setVisible(false);
  this.dismissZone = this.add.rectangle(/* ... */)
    .setInteractive()
    .on('pointerdown', () => this.openPanel());
}
```

## Drag-overlay debug checklist

When an interactive child silently ignores clicks/taps:

1. **Depth audit** — grep the parent container and any nearby children for `.setDepth(`. Note every depth value in the overlay tree.
2. **Ask:** is there any invisible `.setInteractive()` zone at a higher depth than the broken child?
3. **`removeInteractive()` on dismiss** — if using Pattern C, make sure the dismiss zone is either destroyed or has `removeInteractive()` called before the panel opens.
4. **`blockOnDrag` on tweens** — if a drag gesture is mid-flight, interactive children may be temporarily blocked. Verify the pointer-up handler actually fires `dragend`.
5. **Test on TOUCH, not just mouse** — Phaser's pointer unification is excellent, but some overlay bugs only reproduce under real touch events. Use Chrome DevTools device emulation or a real device.
