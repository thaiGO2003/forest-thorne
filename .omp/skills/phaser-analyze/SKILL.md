# Phaser 4 Brownfield Project Analysis

Perform a comprehensive analysis of an existing Phaser 4 project to assess architecture quality, identify performance risks, flag API correctness issues, and produce a prioritized improvement roadmap.

## Analysis Process

Follow all five phases in order. Do not skip phases — each builds on the previous.

### Phase 1 — Discovery

Gather raw facts about the project before making any judgments.

- Read `package.json` for dependencies and Phaser version
- Glob for all `.ts`/`.js` files in `src/`
- Read `main.ts` for `GameConfig`
- Identify all scenes: `grep "extends Phaser.Scene"` across `src/`
- Map scene graph: `grep` for `this.scene.start`, `this.scene.launch`, `this.scene.stop`
- Identify all custom game objects: `grep "extends Phaser.Physics"` or `grep "extends Phaser.GameObjects"`
- Count total source files and lines of code

### Phase 2 — Architecture Assessment

Evaluate the structural quality of the codebase.

- **Scene count and organization** — Are scenes in `src/scenes/`? Are there too many or too few for the game's complexity?
- **State management pattern** — Registry vs globals vs module state. Search for `window.`, module-level `let`/`var` declarations.
- **Asset loading strategy** — Centralized `PreloaderScene` vs scattered `preload()` methods across scenes.
- **Code organization** — Does the project follow `scenes/`, `objects/`, `managers/` conventions?
- **Cross-scene coupling analysis** — Direct references vs event bus vs Registry. Search for `this.registry`, `this.events.emit`, `this.scene.get`.

Rate the architecture **A through F** based on findings:
- **A** — Clean separation, centralized loading, event-driven communication
- **B** — Minor organizational gaps, mostly well-structured
- **C** — Some coupling issues, mixed patterns, functional but messy
- **D** — Significant structural problems, globals, scattered loading
- **F** — No discernible architecture, everything in one file or deeply entangled

### Phase 3 — Performance Audit

Identify runtime performance risks.

- **Object pooling:** Search for `classType`/`maxSize` in group declarations. Flag physics groups created with `this.physics.add.group()` that lack `maxSize` — these leak objects.
- **Particle emitter caps:** Search for particle emitters missing `maxParticles`. Uncapped emitters can spike frame time.
- **Static vs dynamic groups:** Check if platforms, walls, and other immovable bodies use `staticGroup()` (correct) vs `group()` (wastes physics cycles).
- **Update loop weight:** Read each scene's `update()` method. Flag complex logic, object allocations (`new`), or heavy iteration inside `update()`.
- **Texture atlas usage:** Count individual `this.load.image()` calls vs `this.load.atlas()` calls. More than 15 individual image loads is a red flag — should be packed into atlases.
- **Physics body count:** Estimate total active physics bodies from group declarations and individual `this.physics.add.*` calls.

### Phase 4 — API Correctness

Check for deprecated, removed, or misused APIs.

- **v3 API scan:** Search for removed APIs — `Geom.Point`, `Math.PI2`, `Phaser.Structs`, `Camera3D`, `Layer3D`, `FacebookInstant`, `Create.GenerateTexture`, `TileSprite.setCrop`.
- **TypeScript strictness:** Grep for `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, untyped function parameters. These hide real bugs.
- **Asset key consistency:** Cross-reference `this.load.*` keys with `this.add.*`/`this.physics.add.*` keys. Mismatched keys cause silent texture-missing errors.
- **Scene key registration:** Verify all scene classes appear in the `GameConfig` scene array in `main.ts`.
- **Physics body creation:** Flag `this.add.sprite()` calls that should be `this.physics.add.sprite()` (sprites expected to have physics but created without a body).
- **DynamicTexture/RenderTexture:** Check for missing `.render()` calls after drawing operations.

### Phase 5 — Best Practice Check

Verify the project follows Phaser 4 best practices.

- **Lifecycle discipline:** `preload()` should only load assets, `create()` should only build the scene, `update()` should be lean (no asset loading, no object creation).
- **Cleanup on shutdown:** Scenes should clean up — look for `this.events.off`, `this.sound.stopAll()`, timer destruction, `this.events.on('shutdown', ...)`.
- **Camera bounds:** Camera bounds should match world or tilemap bounds. Search for `this.cameras.main.setBounds` and compare with world/map dimensions.
- **Input keyboard null assertions:** `this.input.keyboard` can be null in Phaser 4. Check for `this.input.keyboard!` or proper null guards.
- **Physics debug flag:** `debug: true` in physics config should be `false` for production. Flag if present.
- **Console statements:** Count `console.log`/`console.warn`/`console.error` calls. These should be gated behind `import.meta.env.DEV` or removed for production.

## Output Format

Produce a structured report with these sections:

1. **Project Summary** — File count, scene count, lines of code, estimated complexity (small/medium/large).
2. **Architecture Score** — Letter grade (A/B/C/D/F) with rationale for the rating.
3. **Performance Risks** — Ordered by severity (critical/high/medium/low) with a concrete fix suggestion for each.
4. **Code Quality Issues** — With `file:line` references where possible.
5. **Improvement Roadmap** — Prioritized refactoring steps, ordered by impact vs effort.
6. **Quick Wins** — 3-5 changes that can be made immediately for noticeable improvement.

## Automated Pre-scan

Before starting the manual deep review, run the automated analysis script:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/phaser-analyze/scripts/analyze-project.sh"
```

This provides baseline metrics and flags obvious issues. Use the script output as a starting point, then perform the full 5-phase analysis by reading actual source files.
