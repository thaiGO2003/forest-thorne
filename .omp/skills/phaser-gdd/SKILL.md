# Phaser 4 Game Design Document Generator

Generate a comprehensive Game Design Document (GDD) for a Phaser 4 game. The GDD captures every design decision — mechanics, art, audio, progression, technical constraints — in a single Markdown file so the entire team (or solo dev) has a shared reference before any code is written.

## GDD Structure (13 Sections)

Every generated GDD must include all 13 sections below. If the user has not specified details for a section, provide sensible defaults based on the genre and scope, and mark assumptions with `<!-- ASSUMPTION -->` so they are easy to find and revise.

---

### Section 1 — Game Overview

Establish the identity of the game at a glance.

Include:
- **Title** — Working title (can be placeholder).
- **Tagline** — One punchy sentence that sells the hook.
- **Genre** — Primary genre and any sub-genres (e.g., "roguelike platformer").
- **Target Audience** — Age range, player profile, casual vs. hardcore.
- **Elevator Pitch** — Exactly 2 sentences: what the player does and why it is fun.
- **Unique Selling Points (USPs)** — 3-5 bullet points that differentiate the game.
- **Comparable Titles** — 2-3 existing games the user or audience would recognize, with a brief note on what is borrowed and what is different.

---

### Section 2 — Core Game Loop

Define the repeatable cycle that keeps the player engaged.

Include:
- **30-Second Loop** — The smallest atomic action cycle (e.g., jump-land-collect).
- **5-Minute Loop** — A medium arc such as completing a level or a wave.
- **Session Loop** — What a full play session looks like (15-30 min for casual, 60+ for hardcore).

Present each loop as an **ASCII flow diagram**:

```
[Action] --> [Feedback] --> [Reward] --> [Decision] --+
   ^                                                  |
   +--------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Win Condition** — What the player must achieve to "beat" the game or level.
- **Lose Condition** — What causes failure and what happens next (restart level, lose life, game over).

---

### Section 3 — Mechanics Deep Dive

Detail every interactive system the player touches.

Include:
- **Primary Mechanics** — The 1-3 core verbs (e.g., jump, shoot, match). For each: input, physics behavior, edge cases.
- **Secondary Mechanics** — Supporting systems (e.g., inventory, crafting, dialogue). Describe how they feed back into the core loop.
- **Control Scheme** — Map inputs per platform:

| Action | Keyboard | Touch | Gamepad |
|--------|----------|-------|---------|
| Move   | WASD / Arrows | Virtual joystick | Left stick |
| Jump   | Space    | Tap right side | A button |

---

### Section 4 — Progression System

Describe how difficulty, content, and rewards evolve over time.

Include:
- **Difficulty Curve** — Describe the intended ramp (linear, exponential, sawtooth). Reference specific milestones.
- **Unlock Sequence** — What new abilities, levels, or items the player earns and when.
- **Scoring System** — How score is calculated, combo multipliers, leaderboards if any.
- **Replayability Hooks** — What brings the player back (new game+, daily challenges, procedural generation).
- **Estimated Play Time** — Time to first completion and time to 100% completion.

---

### Section 5 — Level / World Design

Plan the spatial structure of the game.

Include:
- **Level Count** — Total number of levels, worlds, or zones.
- **Themes** — Visual and mechanical theme per world (e.g., "World 2 — Ice Caves: slippery surfaces, breakable walls").
- **Flow Maps** — ASCII diagram showing level progression and branching:

```
[Level 1] --> [Level 2] --> [Level 3]
                  |
                  +--> [Bonus Level A]
```

- **Difficulty Scaling** — How enemy count, speed, puzzle complexity, or time pressure increases per level.

---

### Section 6 — Characters & Entities

Catalog every game object with gameplay-relevant detail.

Include:
- **Player Character** — Base stats (speed, health, jump height), abilities, state machine (idle, run, jump, hurt, dead).
- **Enemy Types** — Table format:

| Enemy | HP | Speed | Behavior | Attack | Drop |
|-------|----|-------|----------|--------|------|
| Slime | 1  | 40px/s | Patrol left-right | Contact damage | Coin (50%) |

- **NPCs** — Role, dialogue triggers, quest associations.
- **Collectibles & Power-ups** — Effect, duration, rarity, visual indicator.

---

### Section 7 — UI/UX Wireframes

Define every screen the player sees.

Include:
- **HUD Layout** — ASCII wireframe of the in-game overlay:

```
+---------------------------------------+
| [Lives: x3]          [Score: 00000]   |
|                                       |
|                                       |
|              GAME AREA                |
|                                       |
|                                       |
| [Item1] [Item2] [Item3]    [Pause]   |
+---------------------------------------+
```

- **Menu Flow Diagram** — ASCII showing navigation between screens:

```
[Title Screen] --> [Main Menu] --> [Play] --> [Level Select] --> [Game]
                       |                                           |
                       +--> [Settings]                     [Pause Menu]
                       +--> [Credits]                          |
                                                         [Game Over] --> [Main Menu]
```

- **Screen Mockups** — Brief description of each unique screen (title, main menu, settings, game over, win).
- **Accessibility Considerations** — Color-blind modes, font size options, remappable controls, screen reader hints.

---

### Section 8 — Art Direction

Establish the visual identity and asset pipeline.

Include:
- **Visual Style** — Describe in 1-2 sentences (e.g., "16-bit pixel art with modern lighting effects").
- **Color Palette** — 5-8 hex codes with role labels:

| Role       | Hex     | Usage                  |
|------------|---------|------------------------|
| Primary    | #3A86FF | Player, UI highlights  |
| Secondary  | #FF006E | Enemies, danger        |
| Background | #1B1B2F | Sky, menus             |

- **Resolution & Scaling** — Game resolution (e.g., 800x600), scale mode (Phaser `FIT`, `RESIZE`, etc.), pixel-perfect flag.
- **Animation Guidelines** — Frame counts, FPS per animation type (idle: 4 frames @ 8fps, run: 6 frames @ 12fps).
- **Asset List with Specs** — Table of every required asset:

| Asset | Type | Size | Frames | Format |
|-------|------|------|--------|--------|
| player_idle | Spritesheet | 32x32 | 4 | PNG |
| background_forest | Static | 800x600 | 1 | PNG |

---

### Section 9 — Audio Design Plan

Define the soundscape.

Include:
- **Music Mood per Scene** — Table mapping each scene/level to a musical mood and tempo:

| Scene | Mood | Tempo | Loop? |
|-------|------|-------|-------|
| Main Menu | Mysterious, inviting | 90 BPM | Yes |
| Level 1 | Upbeat, adventurous | 120 BPM | Yes |
| Boss Fight | Intense, urgent | 150 BPM | Yes |
| Game Over | Somber, reflective | 70 BPM | No |

- **SFX List** — Action-to-sound mapping:

| Action | Sound Description | Priority |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Player jump | Short airy whoosh | High |
| Coin collect | Bright chime ascending | High |
| Enemy hit | Soft thud + squish | Medium |

- **Format Requirements** — All audio must be provided in both **MP3** and **OGG** for cross-browser compatibility. Phaser will select the best format at runtime.
- **Volume Hierarchy** — Define relative volume levels: Music (0.4), SFX (0.7), UI sounds (0.5). Describe how they interact (SFX duck music briefly on major events).

---

### Section 10 — Technical Requirements

Pin down the Phaser-specific technical decisions.

Include:
- **Phaser Version** — `phaser` (v4.2.1 stable) unless the user specifies otherwise.
- **Physics Engine** — Choose one and justify:
  - **Arcade** — Simple AABB, best for platformers and shooters. Low CPU cost.
  - **Matter.js** — Full rigid-body physics. Use for games needing rotation, joints, or complex collision shapes.
  - **None** — For puzzle or card games with no physics simulation.
- **Performance Budgets** — Target frame rate (60 FPS), max draw calls per frame, max simultaneous particles, texture atlas size limits.
- **Browser/Device Targets** — Minimum browser versions, mobile device tier (e.g., "must run at 30+ FPS on 2020-era mid-range Android").

---

### Section 11 — Platform Targets & Device Profiles

Specify where the game will run and how input differs.

Include:
- **Primary Platforms** — Desktop browser, mobile browser, PWA, Electron, Capacitor/Cordova.
- **Input per Platform**:

| Platform | Primary Input | Secondary Input |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Desktop  | Keyboard + Mouse | Gamepad |
| Mobile   | Touch | Gyroscope (optional) |
| Tablet   | Touch | Bluetooth gamepad |

- **Deployment Method** — How the game is built and distributed (static hosting, itch.io, app store via Capacitor, etc.).

---

### Section 12 — Monetization & Release Plan (Optional)

Include this section only if the user wants to discuss business aspects. Mark it optional in the output.

Include:
- **Business Model** — Free, premium, freemium, ad-supported, or donation-ware.
- **Milestones** — Key dates or phases:

| Milestone | Target Date | Deliverable |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Prototype | Week 2 | Core loop playable |
| Alpha | Week 6 | All levels blocked out |
| Beta | Week 10 | Feature-complete, playtesting |
| Launch | Week 14 | Polished, deployed |

- **Distribution** — Where the game will be published (itch.io, GitHub Pages, Steam, app stores).

---

### Section 13 — Acceptance Criteria

Every other section describes intent. This one is the only part a machine can check,
and it is what turns the GDD from a document into a specification.

Write each criterion so that it is **observable, numeric, and false when the game is
wrong**. "The player should feel powerful" is not a criterion. "A charged attack deals
3× base damage" is.

Derive criteria directly from Sections 3 (Mechanics), 4 (Progression), and 6
(Entities) — anywhere the design commits to a number, that number is a criterion.

| Criterion | Observable state | Playtest assertion |
|---|---|---|
| Player jumps 3 tiles (96px) high | `player.y` at apex | `player.y`, `atMost: spawnY - 96` |
| Basic enemy dies in 3 hits | `enemy.active` | press attack ×3, then `enemy.active`, `equals: false` |
| Score persists into GameOver | `registry.get('score')` | transition, then `atLeast: 10` |
| Coyote time is 100ms | jump succeeds after leaving ledge | walk off, wait 80ms, jump → `body.velocity.y < 0` |
| Wave 5 spawns 12 enemies | active enemy count | set wave, then `enemies.countActive(true)`, `equals: 12` |
| Holds 60fps with 50 entities | `game.loop.actualFps` | spawn 50, then `atLeast: 55` |
| Boot reaches menu in under 3s | scene key at t=3s | `game.scene.isActive('MainMenuScene')`, `equals: true` |

Group criteria under the milestone that must satisfy them:

```markdown
### Vertical Slice
- [ ] Player spawns at level start and responds to left/right/jump within 1 frame
- [ ] Falling off the map triggers respawn at the last checkpoint within 500ms
- [ ] Collecting a coin increments score by 10 and plays the pickup sound

### Alpha
- [ ] All 8 levels load without console errors
- [ ] Enemy AI pathfinds around static geometry (no wall-clipping over 30s)
```

Mark anything genuinely subjective as such rather than inventing a fake metric:

```markdown
### Human review required (not automatable)
- Difficulty curve across levels 1-8 feels fair to a first-time player
- Art reads clearly against every background
- Audio mix is balanced at 50% volume
```

Save these to `docs/acceptance-criteria.md` alongside the GDD. The phaser-playtest
skill turns each automatable criterion into a scenario assertion, which is how the
design gets verified rather than merely stated.

---

## Post-GDD Workflow

Once the GDD is finalized, guide the user to the next steps:

1. **Scaffold the project** — Use `/phaser-new` to generate the base project structure matching the GDD's technical requirements.
2. **Design the architecture** — Use the **phaser-architect** skill/agent to translate the GDD into a technical architecture: scene graph, class hierarchy, data flow, and system decomposition.
3. **Start implementing** — Use the **phaser-coder** skill/agent to begin coding scenes, mechanics, and entities as specified in the GDD.
4. **Verify it runs** — `/phaser-playtest` after each vertical slice. Section 13's automatable acceptance criteria become playtest assertions, which is how the design gets checked rather than merely stated.
5. **Ship it** — `/phaser-release` runs the readiness gate and prepares the store presence.
6. **Iterate on what players say** — `/phaser-feedback` turns their reports into failing playtest scenarios, then fixes, then regression tests.

If the user arrived here without a sharpened concept — a genre rather than a hook, or a scope that has not been sized against their available time — send them to `/phaser-brainstorm` first. A GDD written around an unscoped idea documents a project that will not finish.

Remind the user: the GDD is a living document. Update it as the game evolves during development.

---

## Output Format

The generated GDD must be a **single Markdown document** with:
- A top-level `# Game Design Document: [Title]` heading.
- Each of the 13 sections as `## Section N — Name` headings.
- **ASCII diagrams** for all flow charts, wireframes, and level maps (no external image dependencies).
- Tables for structured data (enemies, assets, audio, controls).
- `<!-- ASSUMPTION -->` comments next to any detail the generator inferred rather than received from the user.

Save the document to `docs/GDD.md` in the project root. If no project directory exists, print the full GDD inline in the chat.
