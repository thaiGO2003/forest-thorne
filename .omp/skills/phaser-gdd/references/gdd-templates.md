# GDD Template Examples

These three outlines show how a complete 13-section GDD reads for different genres. Each makes concrete design decisions rather than leaving blanks. Use them as starting points and replace every detail with your own.

## Platformer: "Crystal Caverns"

1. **Game Overview:** 2D side-scrolling platformer for ages 8+. Explore crystal-filled caves, avoid traps, and rescue trapped miners.

5. **Levels:** Cave (tutorial), Ice (slippery physics), Lava (rising magma timer), Underwater (floaty gravity), Crystal Palace (all mechanics combined).
6. **Characters:** Explorer sprite with 3 hearts and incremental ability unlocks. Enemies: Bats (horizontal patrol), Golems (chase on sight), Slimes (bounce pad on defeat).
7. **UI:** Hearts top-left, crystal counter top-right, minimap bottom-right in large levels. World map screen between levels with node-path layout.
8. **Art:** Pixel art with 16x16 tiles. Core palette: #1d1d2b (shadow), #4488ff (crystal blue), #ff44aa (danger pink), #44ffaa (collectible green). Each world shifts the mid-tones.

4. **Progression:** Endless mode with persistent high score. Daily challenge mode with a fixed seed. Tier milestones (reach white tile) unlock new board shapes.
5. **Levels:** Board variants: small hex (19 cells), medium hex (37 cells), diamond (25 cells), triangle (21 cells). Unlocked sequentially.
6. **Characters:** No narrative characters. Tile tiers have subtle face expressions (calm, excited, radiant) as visual feedback.
