description: Scaffold a new Phaser 4 game project
argument-hint: [template] — platformer, topdown, shooter, puzzle, towerdefense, runner, cardgame, fighting, racing, or blank (default)
---

Create a new Phaser 4 game project. The optional argument specifies the game template archetype.

If an argument was provided ($ARGUMENTS), treat it as the desired game template type (platformer, topdown, shooter, puzzle, towerdefense, runner, cardgame, fighting, racing, or blank). If no argument was provided, ask the user which template they want before proceeding.

## Process

1. **Determine template type** — from $ARGUMENTS or by asking the user.

2. **Check for existing project** — Look for an existing `package.json` in the current directory. If found, warn the user that scaffolding here will add files to an existing project, and confirm before proceeding.

3. **Run the official scaffolder** for a blank project, OR delegate to the phaser-coder agent for a template archetype:

   **For `blank` template:**
   Run the official scaffolder and guide the user through it:
   ```bash
   npm create @phaserjs/game@latest
   ```
   Then follow the setup steps from the phaser-init skill.

   **For `platformer`, `topdown`, `shooter`, `puzzle`, `towerdefense`, `runner`, `cardgame`, `fighting`, or `racing`:**
   - First run `npm create @phaserjs/game@latest` to scaffold the base project (TypeScript+Vite).
   - Then use the phaser-coder agent to generate all game-specific files according to the archetype in `skills/phaser-init/references/template-archetypes.md`.
   - Generate placeholder assets using `Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics` + `generateTexture()` so the game works immediately without real art.

4. **After scaffolding**, tell the user:
   - How to start the dev server (`npm run dev`)
   - What to customize first
   - Which agents and skills are available to help
